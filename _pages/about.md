------
I am currently an electrical engineering student at [Universidad Nacional de Colombia Sede Medellin](http://medellin.unal.edu.co/) crossing the last year of the program. My main research interest focuses on Computer Science applied to multi-physics dynamical systems, particularly in power systems operation.

I am affiliated with [Laboratory of real-time systems management](https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/lab-gstr). I have been working under the direction of [Prof. Ernesto PÃ©rez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=tUz1sE0AAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) and [Prof. Jairo Espinosa](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=DhYW97UAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) in research projects related with real-time cosimulation, risk assesment due to lightning and wide-area monitoring of power systems, and urban traffic control.
