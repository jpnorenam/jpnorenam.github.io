I am a Colombian M.Sc. EE student at the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](http://medellin.unal.edu.co/) with interest in high perfomance computing and DevOps of applicacitions for real-time dynamical systems simulation, supervision and control, particularly for future power system operation.

I am affiliated with the [Laboratory of Real-Time Systems](https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/lab-gstr), working under the direction of [Prof. Ernesto Pérez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=tUz1sE0AAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) and [Prof. Jairo Espinosa](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=DhYW97UAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) in research projects related with real-time cosimulation, risk assessment due to lightning, wide-area monitoring of power systems, and urban traffic control.
