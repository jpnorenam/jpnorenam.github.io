I am a Colombian MSc EE student at the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](http://medellin.unal.edu.co/). With interest in high perfomance computing and devops for applicacition in real-time dynamical systems, particularly in future power system operation.

I am affiliated with the [Laboratory of real-time systems](https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/lab-gstr). I have been working under the direction of [Prof. Ernesto Pérez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=tUz1sE0AAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) and [Prof. Jairo Espinosa](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=DhYW97UAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) in research projects related with real-time cosimulation, risk assessment due to lightning, wide-area monitoring of power systems, and urban traffic control.
