I am currently an electrical engineering student at [Universidad Nacional de Colombia Sede Medellin](http://medellin.unal.edu.co/) crossing the last year of the program. I am affiliated with [Laboratory of real-time systems management](https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/lab-gstr). In the laboratory I have been working in topics related with cosimulation, risk assesment due to lightning and wide-area monitoring of power systems, and urban traffic control under the direction of [Prof. Ernesto PÃ©rez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=tUz1sE0AAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) and [Prof. Jairo Espinosa](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=DhYW97UAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra).
