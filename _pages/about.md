------
I am currently an electrical engineering student at [Universidad Nacional de Colombia Sede Medellin](http://medellin.unal.edu.co/) crossing the last year of the program. My main research interest focuses on Computer Science applied to multi-physics dynamical systems, particularly in future power system operation.

I am affiliated with [Laboratory of real-time systems management](https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/lab-gstr). I have been working under the direction of [Prof. Ernesto Pérez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=tUz1sE0AAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) and [Prof. Jairo Espinosa](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=DhYW97UAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=sra) in research projects related with real-time cosimulation, risk assesment due to lightning and wide-area monitoring of power systems, and urban traffic control.

Current research projects
------
* Virtual integration of the nodes LabGSTR, LabIEC61850 & -LinnoX- on the development of the Real-Time Cosimulation Laboratory for the scientific ecosystem [“Energética 2030”](http://informes.xm.com.co/gestion/2018/investigacion-innovacion-y-desarrollo-de-proyectos/Paginas/energetica-2030.aspx)
* A Software-in-the-Loop Testbed Platform Implementation for New PMU-Based Wide Area Control Strategies for Future System Operation
* Online Risk Assessment of Power System Transmission Lines Based on Multivariate Analysis of Lightning and Weather Data
